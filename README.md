# A Flutter Photo Editor App

I have made a photo editor app using ImagePicker package and image_editor_plus package. 
I have used the following features in this app:
- Add Image from Gallery or Camera
- Apply Filters to the Image or Open the Image in the Editor
- Save the Image to the Gallery
- Reset the Image to the Original Image
